# Employer-specific Git configuration
#
# This file overrides settings from ~/.gitconfig for repos in ~/Developer/employer/
# Update these values when starting at a new employer.
#
# To use:
# 1. Copy this template: cp ~/dotfiles/dot_gitconfig-employer ~/.gitconfig-employer
# 2. Update the values below
# 3. Clone employer repos to ~/Developer/employer/

[user]
	# Your work email address
	email = your.name@employer.com

	# SSH signing key for work (if different from personal)
	# Copy from 1Password → SSH Key → public key
	# signingkey = ssh-ed25519 AAAA...

# Signing is inherited from ~/.gitconfig
# Only uncomment these if you need DIFFERENT signing settings for work
# (e.g., different key, or disable signing for work repos)

# [commit]
# 	gpgsign = true   # or false to disable for work

# If using a different signing key, you may need to override:
# [gpg "ssh"]
# 	allowedSignersFile = ~/.ssh/allowed_signers_employer
